netPoints
---

netPoints allows for an easy and reliable way to transfer data between the client and server.
It also provides a means of clients being able to request any data that you will allow them to, 
all within one call of a function.

### Is this more reliable than just using the Net Library?
---

netPoints is **not** any more reliable than the Net Library as it utilizes it itself. However, 
it makes it easier to utilize the Net Library by providing functionality that would not
normally be there.
